        <p>My future plans with computing are to work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Data Science</a>. I believe this has a good mix of applied programming and data analysis which I find to be an interesting mix. To get into this role I will most likely need a masters degree. After graduating, while working towards my masters, I plan to do either a software engineering or data analytics role. I also plan to get an internship in this field for relevant experience during my course.</p>

        <p>One thing I'm not certain about is how AI will impact this job and other programming/data analysis roles, as this job seems to be something it can do effectively (See <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>). I am concerned that AI will significantly decrease the opportunities in this field, so a managerial role could be an alternative.</p>
